6. Given the digraph `G = (V, E)` where `V = {M, N, O, P, Q, R, S}` and 

`E ={(M, S), (N, O), (P, R), (N, S), (O, M),
	 (N, Q), (O, M), (P, P), (S, M), (O, N), 
	 (S, M), (N, R), (P, M), (M, S)}`

	(a) Specify, if any, a simple path from vertex M to vertex S.

	(b) Specify, if any, a simple cycle, involving at least 4 nodes.

	(c) Is the digraph connected or not connected?

	(d) What is the degree of vertices N and R.

	(e) Represent the digraph using adjacency list representation.

	(f) Represent the digraph using adjacency matrix representation.

7. Draw the undirected and directed versions of the graph G(V, E), where V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and E = {(2, 5), (6, 1), (5, 3), (2, 3)}.

8. How many edges does a graph have 3 vertices of degree 3 and one vertex of degree 5?

9. Mr. A is friend with Mrs. B, but she doesn't like him back. She has a reciprocal friendship with both C and D, but only C considers D a friend. D has also sent friend requests to E, F, G, and H but, so far, only G replied. G also has a reciprocal relationship with A. Draw the corresponding directed graph.

10. Draw the graph from the previous exercise as undirected and weighted, with the weight being 2 if the connection is reciprocal, 1 otherwise.
    
11.  Consider the following network representation using adjency list:
